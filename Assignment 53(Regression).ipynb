    "1. The pickle module: The pickle module in Python is used to serialize and deserialize Python objects. This means that you can save a Python object to a file and then load it back into Python at a later time.\n",
    "2. The with statement: The with statement in Python is used to manage resources. In the code above, we use the with statement to open the file model.pkl in binary mode. This ensures that the file is closed properly when we are finished with it.\n",
    "3. The wb and rb modes: The wb mode in Python is used to open a file in binary write mode. The rb mode in Python is used to open a file in binary read mode."
